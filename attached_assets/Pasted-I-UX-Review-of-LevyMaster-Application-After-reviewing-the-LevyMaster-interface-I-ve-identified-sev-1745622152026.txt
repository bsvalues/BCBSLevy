I/UX Review of LevyMaster Application
After reviewing the LevyMaster interface, I've identified several critical UI/UX issues that need to be addressed to improve usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. Here's my comprehensive analysis:

Critical UI/UX Issues
1. Visual Hierarchy & Layout
Inconsistent spacing and alignment throughout the application creates visual noise
Information density is overwhelming on key pages like the levy calculator
Poor use of whitespace makes content difficult to scan and comprehend
Competing visual elements without clear hierarchy of importance
2. Navigation & Information Architecture
Navigation system lacks clear structure with inconsistent placement of menu items
Critical functions are buried within complex menu structures
User journey isn't intuitive - requires too many clicks to complete primary tasks
Breadcrumbs are missing on many pages, making it difficult to track location
3. Responsiveness & Accessibility
Interface breaks on mobile devices with overlapping elements and text overflow
Color contrast issues create accessibility barriers for users with visual impairments
Interactive elements lack clear affordances - difficult to identify what's clickable
Form elements lack proper labeling for screen readers and assistive technologies
4. Data Visualization & Presentation
Charts and graphs lack clear labeling and explanatory context
Data tables are difficult to parse with insufficient sorting and filtering options
Visualization scales are inconsistent across different reports
Key insights aren't highlighted - users must work too hard to extract meaning
Recommended Improvements
1. Streamlined Interface & Visual Design
Implement a consistent grid system to organize layout elements
Create a clear visual hierarchy using size, color, and whitespace
Develop a cohesive color system with primary, secondary, and accent colors
Add proper spacing between elements to improve readability and reduce cognitive load
2. Improved Navigation & User Flow
Redesign the main navigation with clear categories and consistent placement
Implement task-based navigation focused on primary user journeys
Add persistent breadcrumbs on all pages
Create a quick access dashboard with frequently used tools and recent activities
3. Enhanced Accessibility & Responsiveness
Audit and fix color contrast issues throughout the application
Ensure all interactive elements have clear states (hover, active, focus)
Properly label all form fields and implement ARIA attributes where needed
Optimize the interface for all screen sizes with responsive breakpoints
4. Improved Data Visualization & Reporting
Redesign data tables with clear headers, sorting, and filtering capabilities
Enhance chart designs with proper labels, legends, and contextual information
Add data insight summaries to highlight key findings above visualizations
Implement progressive disclosure for complex data sets
5. User Experience Enhancements
Add helpful tooltips for complex functions and terminology
Improve error messages to be more specific and actionable
Implement guided tours for new users and complex features
Create a consistent feedback system for user actions
Implementation Priority
Navigation & Information Architecture - Most critical for basic usability
Visual Hierarchy & Layout - Essential for reducing cognitive load
Accessibility & Responsiveness - Critical for inclusive design
Data Visualization & Reporting - Important for core functionality
Enhanced User Experience Elements - Polishing touches
