# Web Scraping Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of web scraping functionality for the LevyMaster system. The web scraping feature enhances the system's data import capabilities, allowing users to extract data directly from websites for analysis and processing.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Web Scraping Utility (`utils/web_scraper.py`)**
   - Contains core functions for extracting different types of data from websites
   - Implements text content extraction using Trafilatura
   - Implements table extraction using Pandas
   - Includes specialized functions for extracting MLB scores
   - Handles saving scraped data to files and creating import log entries

2. **Web Scraping Routes (`routes_data_management.py`)**
   - Added routes for displaying the web scraping form
   - Added route for handling web scraping requests
   - Added API endpoint for previewing scraped data before import
   - Integrated with existing import tracking system

3. **Web Scraping UI (`templates/data_management/web_scrape.html`)**
   - Provides a form for entering URLs to scrape
   - Allows selection of data type (text, table, MLB scores)
   - Includes preview functionality before importing
   - Shows usage examples and information

4. **Data Management Integration**
   - Updated data management index page to include links to web scraping functionality
   - Added web scraping to the quick actions section
   - Added web scraping to the data management tools section

5. **Standalone Demo (`web_scraper_demo.py`)**
   - Created a standalone script to demonstrate web scraping capabilities
   - Supports command-line arguments for URL and data type
   - Provides detailed logging of the scraping process
   - Can be used for testing or as a reference implementation

### Supported Data Types

1. **Text Content**
   - Extracts the main text content from web pages
   - Filters out navigation, ads, and other extraneous content
   - Preserves paragraph structure and important formatting
   - Saves as plain text files

2. **Tabular Data**
   - Extracts HTML tables from web pages
   - Converts to structured data format with rows and columns
   - Preserves headers and data types where possible
   - Saves as CSV files for import into analysis tools

3. **MLB Scores**
   - Specialized extraction for baseball scores from MLB.com
   - Parses scores and team information
   - Supports extraction by date
   - Saves in a structured format for sports data analysis

## Testing Results

All three data types were successfully tested using the standalone demo script:

1. **Text Content Scraping**
   - Source: Wikipedia article on web scraping
   - Result: Successfully extracted 24,818 characters of text
   - Saved to: `scraped_data/scraped_en_wikipedia_org_*.txt`

2. **Table Data Scraping**
   - Source: Wikipedia list of U.S. states by population
   - Result: Successfully extracted a table with 60 rows and 11 columns
   - Saved to: `scraped_data/scraped_en_wikipedia_org_*.csv`

3. **MLB Scores Scraping**
   - Source: MLB.com scores for April 1, 2023
   - Result: Successfully extracted game scores data
   - Saved to: `scraped_data/scraped_www_mlb_com_*.csv`

## Current Status

While the core web scraping functionality has been implemented and tested successfully using the standalone script, there are ongoing issues with integrating this feature into the main application interface. The web application is experiencing server stability issues that need to be resolved before the web scraping UI becomes fully accessible.

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Server Issues**
   - Investigate and fix the web server stability problems
   - Ensure proper routing to the web scraping pages

2. **Enhanced Data Processing**
   - Add more specialized data extraction for common sources
   - Implement advanced filtering and cleaning options

3. **Integration with Analysis Tools**
   - Connect scraped data directly to forecasting and analysis modules
   - Add options to schedule regular data scraping for monitoring

4. **User Documentation**
   - Create detailed user guides for the web scraping feature
   - Add examples of common use cases and best practices

## Conclusion

The web scraping functionality significantly enhances the data acquisition capabilities of the LevyMaster system. Once the interface issues are resolved, users will be able to easily import data from online sources, complementing the existing file-based import methods. The standalone script provides a working demonstration of these capabilities and can be used immediately for testing or as a command-line alternative.
